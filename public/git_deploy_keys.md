# Git Deploy Keys

**Note** If you are running the rails server you can view this at http://localhost/git_deploy_keys.md

**rails-aws** works by using ssh-keys on the amazon ec2 instances for fetching the code base.

As such these keys will be generated and stored in the location you run this from.

This can be overriden with manual edits to **config/rails-aws.yml**
